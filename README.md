# Generative Art: Tidal Data Spiral Visualization

This project fetches tidal data from the Hong Kong Observatory and visualizes it as a moving spiral using Pygame.

## Features
- Fetches and parses tidal data from https://www.hko.gov.hk/tide/eCLKtext2027.html
- Visualizes tidal heights as a dynamic spiral
- Built with Python and Pygame

## Setup

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Requirements
